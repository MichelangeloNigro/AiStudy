# AI Behavior Tree in Unity


## Overview

This project explores the implementation of AI behavior using behavior trees in the Unity game engine. Behavior trees are a powerful tool for defining complex AI behaviors in a hierarchical, modular, and easily understandable way. In this project, I demonstrate how behavior trees can be utilized to create intelligent and dynamic AI agents for various purposes within a game environment.

## Features

- **Behavior Tree Implementation**: Utilizes behavior trees to define AI behaviors.
- **Modular Design**: Behavior tree nodes are modular and easily customizable.
- **Unity Integration**: Seamless integration with Unity engine for easy implementation and testing.
- **Demo Scene**: Includes a demo scene showcasing the AI behavior in action.
